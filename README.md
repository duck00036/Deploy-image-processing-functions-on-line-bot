# Deploy image processing functions on line bot
This chatbot is developed using the LINE Messaging API and deployed on AWS Lambda functions, leveraging the power of cloud computing to provide fast and reliable image processing capabilities. Its primary function is image processing, with the chatbot capable of performing three key functions:

1. Searching for photos based on user-defined text, enabling users to quickly find the photos they need.

2. Classifying objects in user-uploaded photos and returning a post-processed picture along with a text description of the number of objects identified.

3. Cartoonizing people in user-uploaded photos and replying with a processed photo featuring cartoonized people.

With its image processing techniques and cloud-based infrastructure, this chatbot provides users with a fun and engaging way to enhance their photos quickly and easily.
